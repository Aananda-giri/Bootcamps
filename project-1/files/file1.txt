🚀 First Release of Our Nepali Search Engine!

We are excited to announce the very first release of our new Nepali search engine — built especially for Nepali language, culture, and content.

🌐 Why this matters:
Most search engines today are not optimized for Nepali users or local content. Our goal is to change that — by creating a fast, simple, and reliable way to search the Nepali web.

🔍 What you can expect in this release:

Search results focused on Nepali websites, blogs, and news

Support for searching in Devanagari script

Clean, minimal design in Nepali and English

A growing index of locally relevant pages

🙏 This is just the beginning. Your feedback will help us improve and grow. Thank you for being part of this journey toward digital sovereignty in our own language.

Try it now and spread the word!
नेपालको लागी, नेपालीमा खोज्न सुरु गरौं।
