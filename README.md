# Bootcamps

This repository contains code and resources from various bootcamps on different technologies. Each bootcamp has its own branch, where the relevant content is organized and maintained.

## Available Branches

### 1. Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS) Bootcamp:
- **Branch:** [`book_nnfs`](https://github.com/Aananda-giri/Bootcamps/tree/nnfs_book)
- **Description:** This branch contains code and resources from the book [Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://nnfs.io/) by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça. The content focuses on building neural networks from the ground up without relying on external libraries, providing a deep understanding of deep learning fundamentals.
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Building neurons and layers from scratch
  - Implementing activation functions: ReLU, Softmax, Sigmoid, and Linear
