## Part-4 Improving RL Training performance
* Dont make punishments very high.
* Eucledian distance (reward getting closer to reward?) (reward for chasing apple higher than moving in circle)
* Use a sparse reward function (when the agent gets close to the reward, the reward is high. When far away from the reward, the reward is low)
