Manupulation Engine :: persuasive psychology
If something is just a tool, its genunely sitting there waiting patiently (bicycle), If it's not a tool, it's demanding things from you (tiktok, twitter, email, reddit, facebook)
tool based technology environment to an additction and manupulation based technology 
there are only two industries that call it's customers 'users': illegal drugs and software.
biological imperative to connect to other people, find mate
we evolved to care whether other people in our tribe think well of us or not, cause it matters not 10,000 people judging us every 5 minutes.
training new generation of peopole : when we are lonely, afraid, unsure : we have digital things to do
will we adapt to live with it as we adapted ourself with others before: tv, newspaper
AI already todays world
algorithms: opinions embeded in code
- Personalized feeds
- Effective tool for persuation

- political and personal polairization <political propaganda> :: we don't whats true anymore
- find rabbit hole closest to your interest; watch one of 
- convincing people earth is flat.
- pizzaGate Group :: anti-vaccine group -> pedofile at pizzaGate, 
- climate change is Hoax
- coronaVirus is Hoax
- fake news on twitter spreads 6* faster than real news
- system that biases towards false information <truth is boring>
- Everything is conspiracy
- AI can't solve fake news problem
- technology bringing worst in society creating existantial threat

- Many people in tech industry don't give these tools to their own children


- fillipines, hongkong political 

I thing we'll miss this age:
- When people used to drive their veicheles.
- When people used to have jobs and a purpose, a reason to wake up early in the morning
- money for which people used to work for
- when pepole were manipulated less effectively
- 
- we have clearer sense of world

Education system
-------------------------------
I have given 18 years of my life to it. I have 1 more year of college. that's about one third of my life.
The intention was good: to give knowledge to people.
The implementation: solid, unchangable syllabus even if it is outdated, 80% compulsory attandance.
classes : not much different than Jail. At least your time is yours in jail.
and they will label you "pass" or "fail" with syllabus of their choise.
Sure you can choose which faculty you want to study but actual subjects in the syllabus are fixed.
One size fits all.
A long lasting business model. There will always be new batch of students to teach all the crap the system has taught them.

- a graduate student gives 19 years of their life to education system
- thats about one third of their life
- yet most of them are failures
- drivers, one of the lowest jobs require SEE pass. i.e. they give 13 years of their life to education system. Education system failed them
- Perpetuator of education system <teachers> : They are another failures of education system.They enter the system to become someone in s[ecific domain. But they know nothing more than how to remember to pass in exams. So they teach it to others.

American Express collecting data before NSA

# Larry Ellison
- not my intensiont o build big company
- hired the most tallented software engineers in silicon valley and set off to build the world's first relational database
- all experts don't thought relational databases coud be as fast as classic database.
- Oracle doubled in size year by year by year..
- I set out to create perfect programming job for me, instead i created a job where I had to stop programming all-together..
- and than we went public, maybe I should have been doctor.
- I worked all the time.
- My best friend :: the guy who had alot of crazy ideas.
- take over apple :: I am not doing this for money. If we do this, it'd be for moral high-ground.
-  Deep inside all of us, There is a primal desire to do something in our life, froid said there are only two things important in life:: love and life, he didn't said love and work are the same things.
- It's not just a job, it's an adventure, I have no idea how it ends.
- don't be afraid to experiment and don't let experts discorage you when you challenge the status quoe. What's an expert anyway - just a guy from another town - mark Tawne.
unexpected opportinuties would approach you and you'd change the world.
- Soon you'd get a new job, I hope it interests you, challanges you, and rewards you with the sense of purpose and satisfaction if it didnt keep searching, it's out there, It might take a while but keep searching.
- untill you find a job that ignites your passion


# MArk zuckerberg
- No one does when they begin, ideas don't come out fully formed, they only become clear as you work on them, you just have to get started.
- It's really good to be idealistic. Be prepared to be mis-understood. Anyone taking iniciative will always get criticized for moving too fast. Because there is always someone who want to slow you down.
- don't take on big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes. If you do all the right things today, we do nothing..
- How about modernize so that everyone can vote online.
first: create a warld where everyone has a sense of purposee
second: redefining our idea of equality, so everyone has a freedom of starting their ideas
facebook was not the first thing I made. Greatest successes come from having a freedom to fail.
- If I didn't know i'd be fine if facebook didn't work out then I woudn't be standing here today.
- Every generation defines it's idea of equality..
- we should explore ideas like universal Basic income to make sure everyone has a cusine to try out new ideas.
- Citizen of the world
- A student in the dorm connecting one community at a time until we connect the whole world.
- "may the source of strength who's bless the ones before us help us find the courage to make our life a blessing"

# Jeff Bezos
- resourcefullness, team resource-fullness.
- It's harder to be kind than clever.
- when you think about things you'll regret in your 80's will almost always things you didn't do.
 <act of omission>
- stay focused on your customer satisfaction not on your competator.
- when someone criticize, look @ mirror, if they are right : change it
two kinds of critics: well meaning critics:: they're worried for it may not work and they want it to work
- self interested critics : competetors , institution ... , new way, if costumer embrace new way, who are practicing old way are not gonna like you
- If you're gonna do anything new or innovative you have to be willing to be misunderstood.
- I focus on what we can control.
- all large institutions should be scrutunized and examined, it's reasonable. big government, universities
- we're skeptical of big institutions, millitary, government, it's not personal, they have too much of power.
- @ scale internet is 100-15 years old.
- you don't want block innovation, one of main problem with regulation is it favours incompetence.
- earning trust of customers is valuable business asset, if you mis-treat their data, they'll somehow figure it out.
