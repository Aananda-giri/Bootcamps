Python is an interpreted programming language.
This means that Python code is compiled at runtime,
unlike some other languages where the code is first compiled
to create an executable which can then run.
The Python interpreter is already installed on the cloud
desktop, and in order to run it, all we have to do is type
python3
in the command prompt and hit
Enter. Once you do that,
you will see that the command prompt will change
to these three triangle brackets.
This means that the interpreter is now running and
anything that you type
in now on this new command prompt, it's considered python
code. And the interpreter
will try to compile and execute that code. So let's try it
out. Let's do something super simple and just type
in a mathematical expression.
So let's write five
plus five minus nine. Right. And press enter.
Okay, so there we go.
The interpreter evaluates the expression and prints out
the value. We will see the result and then another command
prompt below it.
Okay, so let's try something else.
Let's multiply 423 by 839.
Press enter and there we go.
We get the result as expected.
Cool, but this seems a bit limiting.
So let's expand on what we can do with python a bit and talk
about variables in the next task.
Don't close the command prompt window just yet.
We will continue to use it in the next task.
