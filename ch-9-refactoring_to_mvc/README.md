# Chapter 8: MVC

- Model view controller
  Model: structure of the data
  View: what is presented to the user (e.g. ejs files)
  Controller: controls requests of user and genereate appropriate response

- user interacts with view, which genereates appropriate request which is handele by controlller which then renders the appropriate view with Model data as response.

- in this chapter, we will refactor controller layer
- `controllers/newPost.js`
