# ch.3 Exploring multi agent systems
- Crew AI,  Auto-Gen Studio \<by microsoft\>


# AutoGen
- By microsoft
- Assistant agent: one that is actually writes the code
- user proxy agent: installs requirements, runs the code, give errors to assistant agent, acts on our behalf

AutoGen is conversational multi agent platform.
- user proxy agent and assistant agent communication


## Export openai api key for autogen ui
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY= <opeanai-api-key>`

```


## Run autogen ui
`autogenstudion ui --port 8000`

## UI components

1. Team Builder:
  - build team of agents (user_proxy + other agents.)
  - team is the group of agents (user_proxy + other agents.)

2. Playground
  - chat interface for testing how teams respond to different quries

3. Gallery
  - Create, Edit and delete: Teams, agents, tools, models, terminations

5. Deploy
  - shows docker or python code to deploy the agent

e.g. cerating an agent:

- click new team in team builder
- drag and drop the calculator to the agent.
-download config and save as team.json
- run code given in deploy part to deploy the team just created

- to serve the team: 
`autogenstudio serve --team path/to/team.json --port 8084`
          

## primary interface is chat
- better to run in docker.

## 4.2.2 Enhancing code output with agent critics
- user_proxy <first-agent> -> Engineer <second-agent> -> Critic: give feedback on code generated by engineer <third-agent>

## 4.2.3 Autogen Cache
  - enabled by default
  - allows agents to continue conversation if they get interrupted

## 4.3 Group Chat with AutoGen
  - childrens telephone game: children are arranged in row and message is wishpered from one child to another, at the the last child gets different message from what have been wishpered to first one. to avoid that, autogen have group chat. 
  - Group chat: agents participate in shared conversation


# Crew AI:
 - Built with enterprise system in mind (more robust, less extensible in some areas)
 - assumes agents only work among themselves and do not require user_proxy agent
 - agents are assigned to tasks that may include memory or tool to assist them.
 - supports sequencial or hierarchical task structure

## Components
  - Agents: 
  - Tasks: research on this topic, call apis, access data, ..
  - tools: search call apis, access data, ...
  - Memory: Conversational, Task specific, semantic, ...


## Example: Creating jokester crew of CrewAI agents
- 


## agentOps: Observe working agents
 - AgentOps: Support observability with any agent platform,  specific to llm usage.
 - installing agentops: `pip install agentops`
 - visit: `https://app.agentops.ai`, create project, settings-> projects->API_KEY create api keys, save to .env file: `AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<<agentops-api-key>>`

## Hierarchical processing in crewai
                        manager
                      ------------
Agents    - researcher           - writer
TAsks:     - research on this topic      - write on this topic
