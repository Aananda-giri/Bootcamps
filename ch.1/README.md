- openai avoids word agent because historically agent is self deciding and autonomous

- use cases: 
  - direct user interaction
  - Agent/assistant proxy: dalle3 through chatgpt (llm better formulates prompt to generate image) (perforn tasks on users behalf)
  - Autonomous agent: Agent interprets users request, construct plan and identifies decision points and execute steps in the plan. (ethical and saftey concerns.)


- Action generation method

- AutoGPT: One of the first autonomous agent system.
- AI Interface: software will be interfaced through natural language (not api or ui)

Prompt chaining:
 improve the performance and reliability of these models by breaking down complex tasks into a series of smaller, more manageable prompts.

Self consistancy:
 - ability of a model to maintain logical coherence and alignment with its own outputs across different prompts or contexts
 - e.g. letting llm generate multiple answers and checking consistency across them .
 - e.g. generate multiple answers to a math problem and use majority voting.
